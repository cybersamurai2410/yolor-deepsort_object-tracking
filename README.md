# YOLOR-DEEPSORT-Object-Tracking

This project combines the power of YOLOR, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system, with Deep SORT, a highly efficient object tracking algorithm. The result is a robust and accurate object tracking solution capable of tracking multiple objects across video frames with real-time performance.

**Key Features:**
- Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes YOLOv4 to detect objects in video frames with high accuracy and speed.
- Object Tracking: Employs Deep SORT to track detected objects across frames while maintaining their identities.
- Multiple Object Tracking: Capable of tracking multiple objects simultaneously, making it ideal for scenarios with crowded scenes.
- Highly Efficient: Designed for real-time performance, ensuring smooth and responsive tracking.
- Easy to Use: Provides a straightforward interface for integrating object tracking into your applications.
